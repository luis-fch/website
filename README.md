My own website! Really simple and minimalistic I would say. I intend to expand it with other features in the near future, and hopefully use it as a portfolio when I get real-world work experience.

## Usage

To run locally, clone or fork the repository. I use `bun` as the package manager, refer to the [bun installation guide](https://bun.com/docs/installation) if needed.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `bun install` | Install the dependencies |
| `bun dev` | Start the local dev server |
| `bun build` | Build the production site. Defaults to `./dist/` directory |
| `bun preview` | Preview the local build before deploying |
